# MCVastProject
Visual analytics is gaining popularity due to its spatial presentation of information.
The VAST Challenge 2022 offers tasks for researchers to develop visual
analytics applications. As part of my CSE 578 class, I created a
dashboard consisting of six interconnected charts with widgets to analyze travel
patterns in a fictional city called Engagement. The project focuses on urban
planning to accommodate growth in small suburbs and towns. The visualizations
present the data aesthetically and provide an overview of daily routines in
the city over 15 months.
